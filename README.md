## Introduction

Parallelism and concurrency are essential concepts in modern software development, especially when dealing with multi-core processors and responsive applications. These terms are often used interchangeably, but they have distinct meanings:

## Parallelism vs. Concurrency

- **Parallelism** refers to the simultaneous execution of multiple tasks or processes to improve performance. It takes advantage of multi-core processors by running tasks concurrently. In C#, this is often achieved using constructs like `Parallel.ForEach` or `Task.Run`.

- **Concurrency** deals with managing the execution of multiple tasks, but not necessarily at the same time. It's more about efficient task scheduling and handling shared resources. C# provides features like `async/await` and the `Task` class to work with concurrency.

In this repository, you will find examples of both parallelism and concurrency in C# to illustrate the practical differences between these concepts.

## Examples

Here are some of the examples you'll find in this repository:

- **Parallel Data Processing**: Demonstrates how to process data concurrently using `Parallel.ForEach`.
- **Concurrency with async/await**: Shows how to use `async/await` for asynchronous, non-blocking code.
- **Task Parallel Library (TPL)**: Examples of using the Task Parallel Library for parallelism.
- **Parallel LINQ (PLINQ)**: Illustrates how to use PLINQ for parallel data processing.
- **Concurrency Patterns**: Examples of common concurrency patterns like producer-consumer and reader-writer locks.

## Usage

To use these examples, clone this repository or download the code for a specific example you're interested in. Each example typically includes a README file with instructions on how to run the code.
